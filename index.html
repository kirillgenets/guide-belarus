						kolozha church
					</h3>
					<p class="sight__text">On the bank of the Neman there is an ancient Kolozhskaya church and looks at Grodno. And so it’s almost ten centuries. This place is unique. And not only with its architecture, but also with its own atmosphere, which every Belarusian should absorb. This is a living story, the soul of the country.
					Kolozhskaya (or Borisoglebskaya) church is rightly considered a historical and architectural reserve. This monument of architecture of the XII century is the pride of Belarus, especially since there are no analogues of such religious constructions in the country. Kolozhskaya church is a bit like the Grodno Cathedral, built earlier – the Lower Church. Unfortunately, it has not survived, but archaeological research makes it possible to compare these two buildings.</p>
